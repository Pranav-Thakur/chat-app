## 🔑 Architecture Overview

- Client authenticates via OTP → JWT is set as HttpOnly cookie
- User connects via WebSocket with STOMP client
- Messages are pushed via `/app/chat.send`, routed to `/topic/messages` if recipient is online
- Chats are stored in MongoDB under sender-receiver `PersonalChats`
- Each session/device tracked using a `deviceId` and `ip`

Let me know if you'd like to [add CI/CD instructions or Dockerization setup](dr) — would be the next logical prod step.
